# Combat Math

## The mechanics of combat

- The attacker rolls their weapon die and subtracts the target’s armor, then deals the remaining total to their opponent’s HP. Unarmed attacks always do 1d4 damage.
- If multiple attackers target the same foe, roll all damage dice and keep the single highest result.
- Damage that reduces a target’s HP below zero decreases a target’s STR by the amount remaining. They must then make a STR save to avoid critical damage. 
    - Any PC that suffers critical damage cannot do anything but crawl weakly, grasping for life.  If given aid and rest, they will stabilize. If left untreated, they die within the hour.
- If a PC’s STR is reduced to 0, they die.

## Typical PC
- 3d6 for STR (Let's say 11)
- 1d6 starting HP (Let's call it 4)
- Say 2 armor as baseline. (Chainmail or Brigadine+helmet, etc.)


## Example Monster

Grizzly Bear
: 6 HP, 15 STR, claws (d8)

Root Goblin
: 4 HP, 8 STR, 14 DEX, 8 WIL, spear (d6)

Hooded Men
