Oh gosh, what are you doing here? You probably want to mosey over to [original site](https://cairnrpg.com/) for Cairn. This is just a fork I made to mess around with some stuff.

Cairn is an [adventure game](http://questingblog.com/adventure-game-vs-osr) about exploring a dark & mysterious Wood filled with strange folk, hidden treasure, and unspeakable monstrosities. Character generation is quick and random, classless, and relies on fictional advancement rather than through XP or level mechanics. It is based on [Knave](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/250888/Knave) by Ben Milton and [Into The Odd](https://chrismcdee.itch.io/electric-bastionland) by Chris McDowall. The game was written by [Yochai Gal](https://newschoolrevolution.com).

The PDF version is available for free on [Itch.io](https://yochaigal.itch.io/cairn) & [DriveThruRPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/330809/Cairn).  
The full text is licensed under [CC-BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).  
The original Affinity Publisher file is also available with the downloads.

A print version of Cairn is now available!  
See the [Print](/print.md) page for more.
